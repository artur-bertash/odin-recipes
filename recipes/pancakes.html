    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <h6>Step 1</h6>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure everything is
        evenly distributed.</p>

    <h6>Step 2</h6>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together. Do not combine the wet and dry
        ingredients until right before cooking.</p>

    <h6>Step 3</h6>
    <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix gently with a wooden spoon or fork until just blended.
        Avoid over-mixing to keep the batter light and fluffy.</p>

    <h6>Step 4</h6>
    <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Scoop the batter onto the griddle, using
        approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden
        brown on both sides.</p>
